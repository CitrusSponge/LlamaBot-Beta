# LlamaBot-Beta
This is a Discord.js bot build on Komada framework that, as expected, is only being worked on by myself (ViiRal) and needs serious help. lol. 
if anyone is kind enough to look through the existing code, and find issues, or commit to the existing code, that would be great.

(Once this bot is up to par, it will take the place of the main bot, that at the time of typing this has over 204 servers)
